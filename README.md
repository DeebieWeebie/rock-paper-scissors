# rock-paper-scissors
This is a game that plays 5 total rounds of rock, paper, scissors.  
It allows the user to enter their choice in any caps/lower case format.  (It does not trim extra spaces, however).  

The game announces what round it is on, announces each choice, keeps score, and announces when each round is finished.  It plays "best of 5" rounds, so the highest score wins, and the game then announces the winner.
